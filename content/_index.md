# Welcome to x308's blog! :D

![image](/cat.jpg)


Hi, Im Abhijith, but everyone calls me Biju. I come from calicut and my interests lie in 
programming and robotics. Other than those, I am also into music and games. As someone with great taste 
in music _(wink wink)_, it would be a crime if i dont include a song recommendation section in this blog. 

### Song Recommendations: 
- Playing God - Polyphia
- Sweet Child O' Mine - First to Eleven  
- Arms Tonite - Mother Mother
- My Hair is Green - 015B, youra 
- Joker and the Thief - Wolfmother

x308 is someone who is into rock music and if youre also someone who is into rock music, do check out this cover band
called First To Eleven. They make covers on rock songs and sometimes even take non rock songs and rockify them.

Another band worth mentioning is Polyphia. They're an instrumental progressive rock band whose style falls somewhere between
blisteringly fast metal-god virtuosity and pure pop. Well, to be honest, you cant really classify polyphia into a genre.
In many ways, it's this lack of classification that has catapulted them to the top of the instrumental metal scene. There
is no one quite like Polyphia.

x308 is also an enjoyer of games like the Assassin's Creed Series and Batman Series. This is yet another part that requires its own
recommendation section.

### Game Recommendations:
- Assassin's Creed Black Flag
- Batman Arkham Knight 
- Osu (Weird one but trust me)
- Pokemon Sun/Pokemon Moon 
- Megaman ZX (Underrated at this point of time)

Well, thats all for this blog. Stay tuned for the next one! :D
